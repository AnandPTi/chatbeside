Full stack Realtime chatting app(Chat, Group Chat, chatbot, Audio Call, Video Call)

## Here, I have tried to implement the following design and feature

# Chat Application Design Document

## Overview

The Chat Application is a real-time communication platform with features such as one-on-one chatting, group chatting, audio calls, video calls, and a chatbot. The application is built using MongoDB for data storage, Socket.IO for real-time communication, ReactJS for the front-end, and Node.js/Express for the back-end.

## Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture:

- **Client Side:**
  - **ReactJS:** Used for building the user interface.
  - **Socket.IO Client:** Handles real-time communication with the server.

- **Server Side:**
  - **Node.js/Express:** Provides the back-end server to handle requests.
  - **Socket.IO Server:** Manages real-time communication between clients.

- **Database:**
  - **MongoDB:** Stores user data, chat history, and other relevant information.

## Features

### 1. User Authentication

- Users need to sign up and log in to access the application.
- Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication.

### 2. Chatting

- Users can send text messages to each other in real-time.
- Group chatting allows users to create and join multiple chat rooms.

### 3. Audio Calls

- Users can make one-on-one audio calls.

### 4. Video Calls

- Users can make one-on-one video calls.

### 5. Chatbot

- Incorporate a chatbot feature for automated responses and assistance.

## Technical Stack

- **Front-end:**
  - ReactJS
  - Socket.IO Client for real-time communication

- **Back-end:**
  - Node.js/Express
  - Socket.IO Server for real-time communication
  - MongoDB for data storage

## Data Model

- **User:**
  - _id
  - username
  - email
  - password (hashed)
  - other relevant user information

- **Message:**
  - _id
  - sender
  - receiver (for group messages, store an array of receivers)
  - messageType (text, audio, video)
  - content
  - timestamp

## API Endpoints

- **Authentication:**
  - `/api/auth/signup` (POST): User registration
  - `/api/auth/login` (POST): User login

- **Chat:**
  - `/api/chat/messages` (GET): Get chat messages
  - `/api/chat/send` (POST): Send a message

- **Audio/Video Calls:**
  - `/api/calls/audio` (POST): Initiate an audio call
  - `/api/calls/video` (POST): Initiate a video call

## Real-Time Events (Socket.IO)

- `connection`: Establishes a connection with the server.
- `chat message`: Emits when a new message is sent.
- `join room`: Emits when a user joins a chat room.
- `audio call`: Emits when an audio call is initiated.
- `video call`: Emits when a video call is initiated.

## Deployment

- Deploy the front-end on platforms like Netlify or Vercel.
- Deploy the back-end on platforms like Heroku.

## Security Considerations

- Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
- Implement proper user authentication and authorization.
- Sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement end-to-end encryption for messages.
- Add support for file attachments in chat.
- Improve chatbot capabilities with natural language processing.

## Conclusion

The Chat Application is designed to provide a seamless real-time communication experience for users. The modular architecture allows for scalability and easy maintenance, while the chosen technologies ensure a modern and efficient solution.
